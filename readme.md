# This repository

Some projects of mine make use of routines that are to remain close sourced. Here are just a few fake classes which just make sure stuff will compile even though it's not real.
(Another solution could of course be to break open the .csproj file of the respective project and to edit out the line referring to the class in question, but I recommend against that to prevent needless repository conflicts).
